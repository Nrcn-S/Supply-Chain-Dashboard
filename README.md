# Supply-Chain-Dashboard
This fictional Power BI project for the FMCG industry visualizes KPIs such as forecast accuracy, sales-profit comparisons, and supply risks across four product groups, delivering data-driven insights to support planning and decision-making in a realistic business context.
## üîç Key Features
- Production and Sales Analytics: Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) like total profit, revenue, and production volume.
- Target Fulfillment: Visually track production performance with the **Target Fulfillment Rate** gauge.
- Forecasting Accuracy: Evaluate forecast reliability using both **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error).
- Cost Analysis: Explore the relationship between **Production Volume** and **Average Manufacturing Cost** to identify efficiencies.
- Operational Timelines: Monitor critical metrics like **Average Lead Time Delivery** and **Average Lead Time Manufacturing** to pinpoint bottlenecks.
## üìä Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop (Data visualization, dashboard design, and data modeling)
- Power Query (Data cleaning, transformation)
- DAX (All custom measures and KPIs)
- Excel (Initial data structure design and preparing the fictional dataset)
- GitHub (Version control and project documentation)
## üìà Insights Enabled
The dashboard provides actionable insights that help drive strategic and operational decisions:
- **Cost & Efficiency Discrepancy:** Despite higher production volumes, Products B and C exhibit higher unit costs compared to Product A. This contradicts typical expectations of economies of scale, where increased volume is expected to reduce unit cost. The insight calls for a deeper investigation into process inefficiencies, material usage, or production complexities affecting cost structures in high-volume products.
- **Reliable Forecasting:** A low *MAPE of 4.46%* and an *MAE of 12.87 kg* indicate high forecast accuracy. This reliability allows for **better inventory management and production planning**,**minimizing the risks of both stockouts and overstocking**.
- **Production Targets:** An overall **Target Fulfillment Rate of 108.89%** shows strong performance. This insight prompts a review of production goals, suggesting that **targets could be set more ambitiously** to align with actual capacity.
- **Operational Optimization:** By monitoring average manufacturing (*5.52 days*) and delivery (*3.53 days*) lead times, the dashboard helps **identify bottlenecks and improve process efficiency**, **ultimately leading to faster customer delivery**.
## üß† Why This Dashboard Matters
In real-world FMCG operations, slight inaccuracies in forecasts or lead times can result in either excess inventory or lost sales. This dashboard simulates such real-world dynamics and equips decision-makers with actionable insights for smoother supply chain operations.
## üë§ About the Creator
This dashboard was built as part of a learning and portfolio project to demonstrate strong analytical thinking, Power BI modeling capabilities, and real-world business insight in the context of FMCG supply chain management.
