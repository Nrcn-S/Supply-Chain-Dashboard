# Supply-Chain-Dashboard
This fictional Power BI project for the FMCG industry visualizes KPIs such as forecast accuracy, sales-profit comparisons, and supply risks across four product groups, delivering data-driven insights to support planning and decision-making in a realistic business context.
## üîç Key Features
- Production and Sales Analytics: Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) like total profit, revenue, and production volume.
- Target Fulfillment: Visually track production performance with the **Target Fulfillment Rate** gauge.
- Forecasting Accuracy: Evaluate forecast reliability using both *MAPE* (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and *MAE* (Mean Absolute Error).
- Cost Analysis: Explore the relationship between **Production Volume** and **Average Manufacturing Cost** to identify efficiencies.
- Operational Timelines: Monitor critical metrics like *Average Lead Time Delivery* and *Average Lead Time Manufacturing* to pinpoint bottlenecks.
## üìä Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop (Data visualization, dashboard design, and data modeling)
- Power Query (Data cleaning, transformation)
- DAX (All custom measures and KPIs)
- Excel (Initial data structure design and preparing the fictional dataset)
- GitHub (Version control and project documentation)
## üìà, How This Helps in Business
This dashboard provides critical insights that enable data-driven decision-making across the organization:
- Strategic Planning: By analyzing *Production Performance* and *Target Fulfillment*, management can identify bottlenecks and set more realistic production goals.
- Operational Efficiency: The *Cost Analysis* helps procurement and operations teams understand the cost drivers per product, leading to better pricing strategies and cost reduction initiatives.
- Improved Forecasting: Using *MAPE* and *MAE*, the sales and planning teams can continuously evaluate the accuracy of their sales forecasts and adjust their models to minimize errors and prevent stockouts or overstocking.
- Supply Chain Optimization: Monitoring *Lead Time* metrics allows for the optimization of logistics and production schedules, ensuring timely delivery and a more reliable supply chain.
## üß† Why This Dashboard Matters
In real-world FMCG operations, slight inaccuracies in forecasts or lead times can result in either excess inventory or lost sales. This dashboard simulates such real-world dynamics and equips decision-makers with actionable insights for smoother supply chain operations.
## üë§ About the Creator
This dashboard was built as part of a learning and portfolio project to demonstrate strong analytical thinking, Power BI modeling capabilities, and real-world business insight in the context of FMCG supply chain management.
